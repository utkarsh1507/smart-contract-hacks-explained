# Mishandling of ETH Vulnerability

## What is it?

Mishandling of ETH happens when a smart contract receives or sends Ether (`ETH`) without proper checks.
If the contract doesn’t handle failures or unexpected behavior correctly, it can lead to loss of funds, denial of service, or exploitable situations.

---

## Example Vulnerable Contract

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract VulnerableEthHandling {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Deposit Ether
    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Withdraw Ether (vulnerable)
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough balance");

        // Sending Ether without checking return value
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        
        // ⚠️ Vulnerability: No check for success, funds may be lost
        // If the transfer fails, user balance is still reduced
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

### Issues in this contract:

1. **No success check:** If the `.call{value: amount}("")` fails, the Ether won’t be sent but the balance is still reduced.
2. **Reentrancy risk:** Using `.call` before updating state allows attackers to reenter the function.
3. **Unexpected behavior:** If the recipient is a contract with a fallback function, it may exploit the withdrawal logic.

---

## Attack Scenario

* A malicious contract calls `withdraw()`.
* In its fallback function, it calls `withdraw()` again **before the balance is updated**.
* This drains more Ether than intended (classic **reentrancy attack**) or causes unexpected failures.

## Safer Fix

### Method 1: Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern

Update balances first, then transfer ETH.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SafeEthHandling {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough balance");

        // ✅ Effect first
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

        // ✅ Interaction after state update
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
    }
}
```

---

### Method 2: Pull Over Push

Instead of directly sending ETH, let users **withdraw** themselves safely.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract WithdrawalPattern {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    // Instead of sending ETH inside contract,
    // let user call withdraw to pull ETH safely
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No balance");

        balances[msg.sender] = 0;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Withdraw failed");
    }
}
```

## Best Practices to Avoid Mishandling ETH

1. Always use **Checks-Effects-Interactions** pattern.
2. Prefer **withdrawal (pull)** pattern instead of pushing ETH automatically.
3. Always check for `success` when sending ETH.
4. Consider using **ReentrancyGuard** from OpenZeppelin.
5. Avoid using `transfer()` or `send()` (fixed gas limit) — instead use `.call` with proper checks.
